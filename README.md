![Test, Build and Upload artifact](https://github.com/miverboven/review-service-ex/workflows/Test,%20Build%20and%20Upload%20artifact/badge.svg)

This is an example where GitHub Actions are used to establish a CI/CD pipline for a Spring Boot REST Microservice that checks compilation, an integration test against MongoDB and building. Finally it uploads the .jar-file artifact and the Docker container image to Docker hub.
